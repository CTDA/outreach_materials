In order to maintain a consistent look and feel across all of CTDA, please refer to this guide when creating any new materials. 

##Logo
You can find the logo in [this repo](https://github.com/CTDA/logo_designs)

####Use
 1. Whenever possible use the transparent .SVG or .PNG versions. 
 2. Be sure to use black and white versions when printing in black and white.
 3. The vertical logo should only be used in cases where the horizontal version does not fit.
 4. NEVER use on a red background
 5. NEVER put it in a tight box
 6. Put it on a white background, or over an image with a linear white-transparent gradient behind the logo if needed
